# helloWorld
Spring 2016 ICSI 310
An overproduced hello world. The result of in-class live programming while reviewing java. 
Might or might not finish this project, depending on class time, tangents, etc.

Don't do this for your hello world assignment. Your hello world homework can be the very
short version. This is an arbitrary choice for the purpose of review. Your homework is to 
make sure your Java installation is working and that you have a workflow that lets you 
successfully complete assignments.
